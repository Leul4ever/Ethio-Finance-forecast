# Task 2 Report: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 1. Executive Summary
Task 2 involved a multi-dimensional analysis of Ethiopia's financial inclusion landscape. While account ownership has seen significant growth over the past decade, we identified a marked deceleration between 2021 and 2024, contrasting with the explosive growth in digital transaction values following the launch of Telebirr and M-Pesa.

## 2. Key Insights

### Insight 1: The "Registration-Usage" Gap
Despite over **65 million registered mobile money accounts** as of 2024, the perceived account ownership rate grew only **+3 percentage points** (from 46% to 49%) in the last three years. This suggests many Ethiopians view mobile money as a utility rather than a formal financial account.

### Insight 2: Structural Gender Disparity
A persistent **20 percentage point gap** exists between male and female account ownership. Digital identity (Fayda) and mobile money expansion have not yet significantly compressed this gap, potentially due to lower mobile penetration among women.

### Insight 3: The "Telebirr Effect" on Usage
The launch of Telebirr (May 2021) catalyzed a shift in digital payment adoption. The **P2P/ATM transaction ratio** has trended upward, indicating that users are increasingly keeping funds within the digital ecosystem for peer-to-peer transfers rather than immediately withdrawing cash.

### Insight 4: Infrastructure as a Diminishing Marginal Factor
While 4G coverage and mobile penetration have historical correlations with inclusion, their recent acceleration has not translated into proportional gains in *new* account openings, suggesting that the "low-hanging fruit" of urban/tech-savvy populations has been captured.

### Insight 5: Impact of Market Events
Visual overlays confirm that **Telebirr**, **Safaricom Ethiopia**, and **M-Pesa** entries were major milestones for **Usage** indicators, but their immediate impact on **Access** (perceived account holders) is lagged or muted compared to their reach in user registrations.

## 3. Data Quality & Limitations
- **Confidence**: 75% of our exploratory data is tagged as **High Confidence**, with low-confidence data points concentrated in rural-urban disaggregations.
- **Sparse Coverage**: We identified data gaps in **Quality** (reliability of services) and **Trust** metrics, which limiting our ability to model behavioral barriers.
- **Data Gaps**: Rural vs. urban ownership data remains sparse, making it difficult to quantify the "last mile" inclusion challenge accurately.

## 4. Conclusion & Next Steps
Task 2 confirms that the future of inclusion in Ethiopia is moving from **Access** (opening accounts) to **Usage** (reasons to keep money digital). In **Task 3**, we will build formal models to quantify the specific impact magnitudes of these market events on future inclusion trajectories.
